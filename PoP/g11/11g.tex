\maketitle
We have made an visual simulation of oure solar system and compared the simulated data with the data given in the assignment.
Figure \ref{uml} shows the UML diagram we made for this task.

\section*{Vector}
We made an vector class called V3 that have 3 attributes x, y and z. In this class we made a number of static generic function to easily calculate using vectors. V3 is also able to calculate the length of a vector.
We use and instance of this class to store the Planets posistion and velocity and making it easier to calculate the planets movements in the simulation by using the generic functions.

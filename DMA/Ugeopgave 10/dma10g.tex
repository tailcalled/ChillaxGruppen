\section*{Part 1}

We are given 3 linear homogeneous relation of degree 2 describing the run time of 3 different algorithms.

\begin{equation} \label{eq1} u_{n} = u_{n-1} + 4 \cdot u_{n-2} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq2} u_{n} = 2 \cdot u_{n-1} + 3 \cdot u_{n-2} \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq3} u_{n} = 9 \cdot u_{n-2} \end{equation}
\subsection*{a}
For each algoritm we have been asked to find the characteristic equation and its roots.

The characteristic equation for equation \ref{eq1} is:
\[x^{2} - x - 4 = 0\]
To find the roots of this equation we use the quadratic formula
\(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4 \cdot a \cdot c}}{2 \cdot a} \)
, which yields
\(x_1 = 1/2 \cdot (1 - \sqrt{17})\) , \(x_2 = 1/2 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{17}) \)


The characteristic equation for equation \ref{eq2} is:
\[x^{2} - 2 \cdot x - 3 = 0\]
The roots of this is
\(x_1 = -1\) , \(x_2 = 3\)


The characteristic equation for equation \ref{eq2} is:
\[x^{2} - 0 \cdot x - 9 = 0\]
The roots of this is
\(x_1 = 3\), \(x_2 = -3\)

\subsection*{b}
Find constanst $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$ for each algorithm and show the run time is $\Theta (s_1^2)$ for \ref{eq1}, $\Theta (s_2^2)$ for \ref{eq2}, $\Theta (s_3^2)$  for \ref{eq3}.

The formula for a linear homogeneous relation of degree 2, can be made using its characteristic equations roots.
In this case all equations have 2 roots, we can therefore insert the roots in \(a_n=u \cdot s_1^n + v \cdot s_2^n\) as $s_1$ and $s_2$ and get an function for the recursion equation.

Formula for \ref{eq1} is:
\[a_n=u \cdot (1/2 \cdot (1 - \sqrt{17}))^n + v \cdot (1/2 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{17}))^n\]

Because u and v is constants we have that \(u \cdot s_1^n + v \cdot s_2^n = \Theta (s_1^n + s_2^n)\). $s_2$ is bigger than $s_1$ which means that \(\Theta (s_1^n + s_2^n) = \Theta (s_2^n)\) and therefore the runtime is \[\Theta ((1/2 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{17})^n)\]


Formula for \ref{eq2} is:
\[a_n=u \cdot (-1)^n + v \cdot 3^n\]
The same argument as above applyes here and we get.
\[u \cdot (-1)^n + v \cdot 3^n = \Theta ((-1)^n + 3^n) = \Theta (3^n)\]


Formula for \ref{eq3} is:
\[a_n=u \cdot (-3)^n + v \cdot 3^n\]
The same argument as above applyes here and we get.
\[u \cdot 3^n + v \cdot (-3)^n = \Theta 3^n + (-3)^n) = \Theta (3^n)\]

\subsection*{c}
The algorithm with the smallest runtime should go in further development and that is equation \ref{eq1}.
